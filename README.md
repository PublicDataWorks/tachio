## Code Overview

The codebase is primarily divided into three main files: `discord.js`, `capabilities.js`, and `chain.js`.

`discord.js` is responsible for setting up the Discord bot client, handling message creation events, and sending messages or embed messages to the Discord server. It also includes functions to detect if the bot was mentioned or if the channel name includes a bot.

`capabilities.js` contains the definitions of the bot's capabilities. It includes a regex for identifying capability calls, a function for calling capability methods, and a prompt for informing the bot about its capabilities.

`chain.js` is responsible for processing message chains. It includes functions for processing messages, processing capabilities, and getting capability responses. It also handles token limits and generates AI responses based on the result of the capability processing.

`capabilities/_generate-manifest.js` generates the `capabilities/_manifest.json` file, which contains the list of capabilities that the bot can perform. For each capability file, it uses the inline JSDoc comments to understand the methods and parameters avilable.

```js
// capability name
"calculator": [
    {
      // method name
      "name": "calculator:add()",

      // instructions on how to use the method and what it returns
      "description": "Adds up an array of numbers. Returns: The sum of the numbers.",

      // parameter information
      "parameters": [
        {
          "name": "numbers",
          "description": "The array of numbers to be added."
        }
      ]
    },
  ]
```


## Database Overview

### Messages Table

```sql
create table
  public.messages (
    id bigint generated by default as identity,
    embedding extensions.vector null,
    created_at timestamp with time zone null default now(),
    key text null,
    value text null,
    user_id text null,
    constraint messages_pkey primary key (id)
  ) tablespace pg_default;

```

### Storage Table
```sql
create table
  public.storage (
    id bigint generated by default as identity,
    embedding extensions.vector null,
    created_at timestamp with time zone null default now(),
    key text null,
    value text null,
    user_id text null,    
    constraint storage_pkey primary key (id)
  ) tablespace pg_default;
