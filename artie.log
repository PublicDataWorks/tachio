Once installed, go to the Nginx configuration directory (`/etc/nginx/sites-available`) and create a new configuration file.\n3. In this file, you would set up your server block as follows:\n\n```nginx\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n\n    location /app1/ {\n        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/;\n    }\n\n    location /app2/ {\n        proxy_pass http://localhost:3030/;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n4.

Test for syntax errors with `sudo nginx -t`. If there are no errors, restart Nginx to enable your changes with `sudo service nginx restart`.\n\nYour apps should now be accessible from `http://localhost/app1` and `http://localhost/app2`, respectively. \n\nRemember, \"Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment.\" - Buddha","remember":"User's Question: <@&1086506789446615114> How do you route multiple apps running on different ports, for example one is on port 8080 and another is on port 3030, to different paths both accessible from port 80?\n\nKey Details:\n- User asked for assistance in routing multiple apps running on different ports to different paths accessible from port 80.\n- User mentioned one app running on port 8080 and another app running on port 3030.\n- User wants both apps to be accessible from port 80.\n- User is referring to <@&1086506789446615114>.\n\nActionable Insights:\n- Suggested using a reverse proxy server like Nginx or Apache to achieve the desired routing.\n- Provided a step-by-step example using Nginx, explaining the configuration required to route the apps to different paths.\n- Encouraged the user to save the configuration file, enable the site, test for syntax errors, and restart Nginx to apply the changes.\n- Shared the URLs where the apps should be accessible after the configuration is complete.\n\nRefinement Suggestions:\n- None.
